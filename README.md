### Technologies
Music ID uses [Spotify's API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/) and it's [Authorization Code Flow](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/authorization-guide/#authorization-code-flow).
This app was built with express and angular.

### Installation Instructions
Clone down [this]() repository and use `npm install` in your CLI. Run `node server.js` and log in with your Spotify information.

For this application, I wanted it to look fun and "poppy" so I used neon colors on a black background for that effect.

### Hurdles
* Working with the API was pretty difficult in the beginning
* Could not get the audio to work
* Styling was an issue with a number of expressions all around the HTML
